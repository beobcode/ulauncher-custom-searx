# Ulauncher Searx Extension

This extension allows you to search the web using the Searx metasearch engine directly from Ulauncher. It's inspired by [ulauncher-searx](https://github.com/Pegoku/ulauncher-searx) and [ulauncher-duckduckgo](https://github.com/mikebarkmin/ulauncher-duckduckgo). The primary feature of this extension is the ability to choose the Searx instance you want to use.

## Features

- **Custom Searx URL**: Set your preferred Searx instance URL.
- **Flexible Tab Management**: Choose whether to open search results in a new window or in a new tab in the current window.
- **Improved Privacy**: Search queries will use POST rather than GET

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Ulauncher (version 2)
- Python 3

### Installation

2. Go to the Extensions tab.

## Usage

2. Type your search query prefixed with the designated keyword (e.g., `searx`).
